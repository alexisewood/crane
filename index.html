Remember  
in primary school  
playing with fortune tellers  
five girls at my table  
anxiously giddy  

Four.  

1. 2. 3. 4.

I know where that anxiousness comes from – that one type that pushes up from your chest, forcing its way out in a gasping laugh, an embarrassed rebuttal, or tears welling in your eyes. That one that burns the back of the throat.  

We inherent an orientation towards the straight line, a pre-structured distribution of what’s possible, what’s imaginable. We are  

remember  
that nonautonomy as a child  
your actions dictated otherwise  
someone else  
other  

remember  
comfort in being other  
dictated not by someone else  
but something else  
already existing  
in motion  

how could I be grieving  
if my choices  
are not mine to make  

they sit along the ridges  
of this paper  
hidden  
waiting to unfold  
other is a fortune teller  
waiting to unfold

    <div class="poem">
remember  
when you were 15, angsty  
reading Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five  
time is annihilated by space  

simultaneously Billy Pilgrim  
becomes a father and  
is dead, and  
is born, into the  
the bombing of Dresden,  
Tralfamadorians laughing  
at the futility of human time  
human time  
tumbling around in the  
Tralfamadorian zoo  

in that school interview  
you explain that time  
is not real  
you are simultaneously  
alive,  
and dead,  

“Everything that ever has been always will be,  
and everything that ever will be always has been”.  

remember  
how simultaneity  
gives you a place at school  
and a social worker, for that angst

    <div class="poem">
remember  
how the inevitability of it all  
waiting for space to unfold  
along the creases is a  
a comfortable misery  

crushing  

I’ve been thinking about how futures arrive already folded.  
How even in childhood, the world hands us small architectures—  
paper toys, miniature worlds—  
that pretend to tell us who we will become.  

Benjamin reminds us these forms are built from the residues of adult life,  
fragments of a history that believes itself complete.  

A fortune teller is one such fragment:  
a tiny machine for prediction,  
a diagram of straight lines and settled destinies.  

Something interrupts.  
A moment—the cessation of happening—  
when the predicted future doesn’t sit right in the hands that receive it.  
That moment is my protagonist’s awakening:  
the child who opens the fortune teller  
and discovers only graphite, only scribbles,  
only the arbitrary marks that once claimed the authority of fate.  

Unfolding is a gesture of refusal.  
Unfolding is also a revelation:  
the world, once dismantled, lies there as a field,  
a sheet of incomplete possibilities.  

Here Deleuze meets Benjamin:  
the fold is never final.  

Every crease can become another crease.  
Every surface can become a different topology for living.  
And so the child begins again—  
not escaping the material given,  
but refolding it.  

Gladman enters my thinking.  
Sentences are spaces you move through,  
rooms that drift, thresholds that don’t quite hold still.  
Her characters live in architectures made of hesitation,  
where orientation is less a direction than an experiment.  

Refolding the paper into a crane  
is the same kind of experiment:  
a reassembly of space, a new sentence made from the ruins of the old  

And Moten reminds us that incompleteness is not lacking  
It is where the fugitive lives,  
in the break, the cut, the refusal to be finished.  
The crane is not a fixed form—it is a fugitive one.  
It carries the marks of its prior life,  
but arranged otherwise.  

It is what happens when a subject consents not to be  
the being the world predicted.  

So this project begins with a child’s paper toy  
and ends with something impossible to foresee—  
a queer, folded, fragmentary future  
that rises from the same material  
but from a different way of touching it.  

Nothing new is added.  

But everything is rearranged.  
And in that rearrangement,  
a new world takes flight.
